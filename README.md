> A speculative theory and experimental framework for storing and retrieving information embedded directly into the geometric and topological structures of spacetime — treating the universe not just as a medium, but as memory.

---

##  Concept Overview

This project explores the idea that information could be encoded, transmitted, and potentially retrieved from perturbations in the structure of spacetime itself. Unlike conventional data storage in material substrates, this framework speculates about:

- Encoding data as curvature, tension, or phase shifts in 4D spacetime
- Using time as an active dimension of storage
- Drawing parallels to gravitational waves, quantum fields, or brane theory
- Bridging General Relativity, Quantum Field Theory, and Information Theory

This is **not** meant for practical application at present, but instead to build theoretical scaffolding, simulations, and eventually conceptual proofs of feasibility.

##  Project Structure




---

##  Goals

-  Define a minimal set of physical constraints that could encode a single bit in spacetime
-  Simulate possible 4D geometries and their information content
-  Model retrieval mechanisms via observers, fields, or wavefronts
-  Publish speculative whitepapers or host thought experiments for feedback

---

##  Inspirations

- Roger Penrose's Twistor Theory
- Holographic Principle (’t Hooft, Susskind)
- Black hole information paradox
- Tensor Networks and spacetime emergence
- Wheeler’s "It from Bit" hypothesis
- Quantum Gravity toy models
